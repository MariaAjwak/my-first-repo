                    <h1>Mangata & Gallo Inventor</h1>
                    <p>Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo.
                        After graduating from design school with a specialization
                        in diamond cutting and metal smithing,
                        Mariana opened a store in her hometown,
                        Austin and started to grow her business online.
                        Mariana has always managed every aspect of the
                        business, from jewelry design to marketing to
                        e-commerce.
                        However, she recently hired several artisans to help craft her designs
                        and a young employee to help manage the company website and social media accounts.
